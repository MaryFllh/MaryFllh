Hey there! I'm Mary(am)  
:woman_student: I did my bachelor's and master's in electrical engineering.  
:brain: For my masterâ€™s thesis at the University of Toronto I worked on brain-computer interfaces and using NLP I designed a context-aware virtual keyboard that can be controlled with brain signals. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt3Xj7BNQZs&ab_channel=UofTEngineering) a link to a short video of me describing my work.  
:woman_technologist: After graduating I have worked at a couple of startups as a machine learning engineer with a focus on NLP, text summarisation and semantic search in healthcare.  
:pen: I enjoy writing and sharing my learnings through blogposts. You can check out my articles on my personal [blog](https://cherrypicked.dev/) and [medium](https://maryam-fallah.medium.com/).
